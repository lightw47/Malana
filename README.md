# Malana
**Malana** is a collection of scripts aimed to help me do static analysis of files, usually malware.

## Dependencies
Malana depends on
- pefile
- ssdeep

pefile can be easily installed via pip (`pip install pefile`)

To install ssdeep, you might have to install some libraries before installing the package itself. On Linux systems,  you just need to install `libfuzzy` before `pip install ssdeep`. On Windows, download [ssdeep Python wrapper for Windows](https://github.com/MacDue/ssdeep-windows-32_64), then run `setup.py install`.

## How to use
I'm improving on this... please wait.
